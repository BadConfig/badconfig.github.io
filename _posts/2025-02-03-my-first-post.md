Hey, this is my first post here. 
Usually people are divided into two categories: *those who talk and those who do.*

I was always preferring to do and it resulted to me never talking enough in digital space. 
Now this plays a bad joke with me, even though I have knowledges in different things that were never documented I'm still a person that no one knows about.

I joined crypto because it was a chance to explore a lot of technical and economical things. Still no industry will give you so much exciting opportunities to try to do things.

This causes the nishe to become very complicated for newcomers and average people in general. Bunch of guys knows how it works and why it works, meanwhile others don't care and try to make money.

This causes people to create and sell shit on top of shit and sell this to VCs. VC are actually not getting what they buy and follow trends. Crowd by trending stuff and VC can exit. Circle repeats.

This vicious circle is fine, untill you realize that we are loosing the main fenomenom of crypto, *where smart people with ideas have a chance to make them work*. 

**Where internet technologies unify the world and people of all countries can build things togeather.**

That's why I created [arcanum.to](https://arcanum.to). 
There is no hot narrative, no backers, no bullshit.

Arcanum Protocol allows you to build tokenized (ERC20) portfolios and allow other people to contribute liquidity, meanwhile professionals trade portfolios and tag it to your strategy.
* It's very cheap to use, trades happen with 90k gas (comparable to Uniswap v3)
* Product is modular and can work with any ERC20 assets that have price.
* You are a full and only owner of your portfolio.


Protocol token is collecting revenue and secure oracles. It's the opposite of memecoin, crisis resistent asset.

The paradigm we build Arcanum is to **make a good old DeFi primitive that helps and works**.

Let's try to change things.
Bye
